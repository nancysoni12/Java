package
______
package is a collection of classes and interfaces

java provide the n number of inbuilt packages to us 
like as 
java.util
java.io
java.sql
etc

but user can create its own package in java 

Q.what is the use of package or why use the package ?
______________________________________________________
the major use of package is to create the distribution 
or library

Q.How to create the package in java ?
_____________________________________
if we want to create the package in java we have the 
some steps

 i) declare the package 
 ________________________
if we want to declare the package we have the package keyword.

syntax:
  package packagename;

e.g package org.test;

ii) declare the classes in it 
  _________________________________
syntax:
package packagename;
access specifier class classname
{
  access specifier returntype functionname(arguments)
   { write here logics 
   }
}

e.g
package org.test;
public class PrintTable
{
   public void showTable(int x)
   {
     for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
     { System.out.printf("%d x %d =%d\n",i,x,i*x)
     }

   }
}
iii) compile the package
    ___________________________
if we want to compile the package we have the command 

javac -d . filename.java

e.g
package org.test;
public class PrintTable
{
   public void showTable(int x)
   {
     for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
     { System.out.printf("%d x %d =%d\n",i,x,i*x)
     }

   }
}

javac -d . PrintTable.java

-d indicate create the folder as per the name of package and 
store all .class file in it.


note: if we compile your package or your java program 
any other location except jdk\bin 

for that we need to set the jdk\bin folder path in enviourmental variable 
in mycomputer


How to set the path of jdk\bin folder ?
____________________________________-

right click on mycomputer --> properties  -->
advanced system setting  -->advanced--> enviourmental variable 
 ---> system variable  --> select the path variable 
 --> click on edit button  --> go at last give semicolon
 and paste jdk\bin path 

once we create the package we can use it more than one time 
any where 

how ?
____
if we want to reuse the package more than one time we have the 
some steps

 i) import the package
   ________________________
 import org.test.PrintTable;

ii) create the object of class from package which want to use 
    
PrintTable p=new PrintTable();

iii) call its method using objectname.methodname

  p.showTable(5);'

Rules of access specifier in package
____________________________________

public  : public access within a same package as well as outside 
package also 

default  : access only within package outside of class 
cannot access outside of package

protected : protected means access outside of package or inside of 
package but only in child class 

private : cannot access outside of class within a same package
as well as outside of package
